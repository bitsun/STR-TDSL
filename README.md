## Chinese Street View Text Retrieval Dataset (CSVTR)

CSVTR consists of 23 pre-defined query words in Chinese and 1667 Chinese scene text images collected from the Google image search engine. Each image is annotated with its corresponding query word among the 23 pre-defined Chinese query words. 

CSVTR could be downloaded from [baidu disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1CqKZ7zZL5U9uSsyBw0l3ag)(asjw) or [google driver](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aC7_a3_2k7skeTT3EeM54UO76jpx9Pm4/view?usp=sharing).

## Trained models
The trained models could be downloaded from [baidu disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vLR4EzXYyof-l69b621jog)(legq).

## Code will be avaliable soon.
